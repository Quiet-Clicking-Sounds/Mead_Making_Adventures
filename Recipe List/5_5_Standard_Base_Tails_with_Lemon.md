Unplanned: 
We had slightly more mead than expected (or we forgot how much we planned for at the beginning)

So off the cuff plan, put both the tails from <a href="Recipe%20List/5_Standard_Base_A.md"> 5 Standard Base A.md</a> 
and <a href="Recipe%20List/5_Standard_Base_B.md"> 5 Standard Base B.md</a> into one demijon
After a little debate we decided to add the leftover lemon (less the zest) 
so chopped it and added it to a brew bag with two 16mm stainless steel ball bearings

Note for later: adding lemon to the bag then stuffing the bag into the demijon is a massive faf, do the other method
where you put the brewbag over the top of the demijon then add the contents through the neck; less faff that way.
