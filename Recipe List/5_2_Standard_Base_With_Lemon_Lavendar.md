# Standard Base With Lemon Lavendar

**Mead had to be binned** The ballbearings we used corroded, not sure why, going to use marbles next time

## plan:

- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3 tsp of Lavendar
    - drop it all in a little boiling water?

## What happened:

Zested a Lemon, added to two tbsp of labendar in a brew bag; placed into the demijon.
We also included a weight in the form of a 16mm Stainless Steel ball bearing;
not quite heavy enough, use two next time.

## Mid-secondary checkin
Smell
Amazing lavendar smell, light being inside a lavendar bush, but slightly citrus

Taste 
Sweet lavendar, not lemony, but a hint of sweet citrus, much less like a wine

Note: should take the brew bag out
Note: did take the brew bag out
