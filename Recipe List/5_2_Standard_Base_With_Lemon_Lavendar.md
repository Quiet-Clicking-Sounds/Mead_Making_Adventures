# Standard Base With Lemon Lavendar

## plan:

- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3 tsp of Lavendar
    - drop it all in a little boiling water?

## What happened:

Zested a Lemon, added to two tbsp of labendar in a brew bag; placed into the demijon.
We also included a weight in the form of a 16mm Stainless Steel ball bearing;
not quite heavy enough, use two next time.
