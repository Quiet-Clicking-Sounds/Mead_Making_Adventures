# Standard Base With Cucumber

## plan:

- 1.5 Litres of Cucumber
    - reduced to 300ml over a low heat

Building on-top of <a href="Recipe%20List/5_Standard_Base_B.md"> 5 Standard Base B.md</a>

## What happened:

- 5 Cucumbers chopped then blended until smooth,
- reduced for 2-3 hours at medium - high heat with intermittent stirring (we got bored with stirring)

Chopped 5 cucumbers when blended until smooth; added that to a pan and had it on a medium high heat for 2-3 hours;
at one point we decided to use a stick blender to make it smoother,
this worked but wouldn't have been neeeded if we had a better blender.

Gave up on reducing

After waiting for the cucumber to cool we squeezed it through cheese cloth to extract most of the liquid, around 1.2
litres

We added 1 litre of this cucumber (juice?)  to the demijon then topped up
with <a href="Recipe%20List/5_Standard_Base_B.md"> 5 Standard Base B.md</a>

## Notes for next time

Reducing cucumber might be possible, should try blending better and then slowly reducing over a much longer timeframe
at lower temperatures; 5-6 hours at 70-80c might work

or don't bother, just blend it really well and squeze the juice out (or buy a juicer)
