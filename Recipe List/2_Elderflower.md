- Aerated twice, first two days, could have done much more
- I've been agitating 2 or 3 times a day, will stop when we finish fermenting
- temperatures have been at a consistent 21-22°C
- 2024-07-19 Syphoned to **Secondary** it's been long enough on the lees, will leave it in the glass demijohn for a few
  months

<h3> Notes </h3>

2024-05-29 Fermentation appears better in this brew than #1, presumably because the elderflower has some amount
of nitrogen available to the yeast

2024-05-29 other brew was given Fermaid K, decided against adding to this brew as co2 production has been
consistent since 2024-05-27, I think our starter nutrient was a little excessive. step feeding next time.

2024-05-31 new hydrometer readings of 1.060 @ 22c, need to wait for a while before testing again to see how much
alcohol we're making. Mead#1 has a 1.068 currently and our starting honey and water levels were the same on both
batches, so that should be the lower end of our SG

<h2>Post Fermentation</h2>

<h3>Stabilization plan</h3>

- Completed: 2024-08-03
- Potassium Metabisulfite: 0.15g
- Potassium Sorbate : 0.85g

<h2> Post Ferment back sweetening</h2>
-  Nothing

Tasting Notes:

- dry, but not extreemely so, the elderflower brings a hint of sweetness
- Both of us find this to be a fantastic mead, we're rather happy with it
- small amount of nail-polish like smell which we think will be gone with a little more aging
- strong smell of elderflower bushes
- hint of dry white wine, or a flat prosecco
- plesant, fresh taste of elderflower.

Serving thoughts:

- Could work well with frozen grapes for chilling
- Frozen fruits would be a good addition
