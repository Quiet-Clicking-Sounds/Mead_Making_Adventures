<h3> Notes </h3>

2024-05-29 Fermentation appears better in this brew than #1, presumably because the elderflower has some amount
of nitrogen available to the yeast 

2024-05-29 other brew was given Fermaid K, decided against adding to this brew as co2 production has been 
consistent since 2024-05-27, I think our starter nutrient was a little excessive. step feeding next time.
