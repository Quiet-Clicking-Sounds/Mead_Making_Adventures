<h3> Notes </h3>

2024-05-29 Fermentation appears better in this brew than #1, presumably because the elderflower has some amount
of nitrogen available to the yeast

2024-05-29 other brew was given Fermaid K, decided against adding to this brew as co2 production has been
consistent since 2024-05-27, I think our starter nutrient was a little excessive. step feeding next time.

2024-05-31 new hydrometer readings of 1.060 @ 22c, need to wait for a while before testing again to see how much
alcohol we're making. Mead#1 has a 1.068 currently and our starting honey and water levels were the same on both
batches, so that should be the lower end of our SG
