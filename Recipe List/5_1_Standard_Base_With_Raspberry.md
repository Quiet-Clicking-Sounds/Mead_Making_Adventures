#Standard Base With raspberry

## plan:

We had planned to do Rhubarb:

- Rhubarb 800g? 400g? 250g?
    - Grated / diced
    - in water, bring to a boil then let cool

but as we couldn't find any when we went do get our additions we swapped over to raspberries; it's still red, close
enough

## What happened:

Adde 500 grams of frozen raspberries to a food processor with around 100ml of water; blended until smooth
(not unlike icecream) then added the around 700ml of raspberry juice to the demijon.

note: not sure how this will do may have to go through and mix it a few times to make sure we're not
getting a layer of raspberry pulp at the top
