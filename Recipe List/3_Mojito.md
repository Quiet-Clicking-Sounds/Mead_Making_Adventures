Plan & Ingredient List

| Ingredient | Planned<br/>Quantity  | Final<br/>Quantity                                    |
|------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Honey      | 1865g (1211g + 654g)  | 1211 + 654?g scales didn't want to cooperate over 2kg |
| Water      | 3427g                 | 3420g                                                 |
| Lime Juice | 3 limes               | 3 limes                                               | 
| Lime Zest  | 3 limes               | 3 limes                                               | 
| Mint       | 8 mint leaves (small) | 5 mint leaves (small)                                 |

- After brewing additions:
    - Mint for some time during secondary if needed
    - Rum to complete the 'Mojito' flavour
        - planning to use a non-spiced rum, possibly an over-proof white rum

<h3>Yeast</h3>

- [17% dry mead Wyeast](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/wyeast-4021-dry-white-sparkling/?v=79cba1185463)
    - Half a packet (2-3x recommended)

Yeast Food:

- feed #1
    - Fermaid K: 2.5 grams at pitch
        - Done 2024-06-23
- feed #2
    - Fermaid O: 3 grams day 3
        - Done 2024-06-27
        - caused quite the energetic reaction, had to replace the bubbler
- feed #3
    - Fermaid O: 3 grams at addition of Honey - at or below 1.050 grav
      - Done 2024-07-03

- Start gravity
    - Expected:1.137
    - Actual: 1.094 before step 1 honey addition
- Final gravity
    - Expected:1.000
    - Actual:
- ABV
    - Expected: 16.0%

notes:

- 2024-06-24 aerated for 3 minutes with a drill attachment
- 2024-06-25 aerated again, likely for the final time
- 2024-06-30 added honey #2, 5 mins of swirling got some of it into suspension, need a better plan for next time
- 2024-07-19 Syphoned to **Secondary** it's been long enough on the lees, will leave it in the glass demijohn for a few months
  - somewhat irritating to syphon with the amount of free-floating lime bits, should leave things in larger pieces next time
