|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Honey            | 1312g (895g + 453g)  | 895 + 496g         |
| Water            | 3788g                | 3780g              | 
| Orange Juice     | 250g                 | 2 oranges (250g)   |
| Orange Zest      | 3 Oranges            | 3 Oranges          | 
| Red Chilli       | 75g                  | 2 chillis (35g)    |

<h3>Yeast</h3>

- [17% dry mead Wyeast](https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/wyeast-4021-dry-white-sparkling/?v=79cba1185463)
    - Half a packet (2-3x recommended)

Yeast Food:

- feed #1
    - Fermaid K: 2.5 grams at pitch
        - Done 2024-06-23
- feed #2
    - Fermaid O: 3 grams day 3
        - Done 2024-06-27
        - a small reaction, I think this is going to be a slower brew, possibly due to the chilli?
- feed #3
    - Fermaid O: 3 grams at addition of Honey - at or below 1.050 grav
        - Done 2024-07-03

## Expectations

- Start gravity
    - Expected:1.132
    - Actual: 1.065 before step 1 honey addition
- Final gravity
    - Expected:1.010
    - Actual:
- ABV
    - Expected: 16.0%

notes:

- 2024-06-24 aerated for 3 minutes with a drill attachment
- 2024-06-25 aerated again, likely for the final time
- 2024-06-30 added honey #2, 5 mins of swirling got some of it into suspension, need a better plan for next time
- 2024-07-19 Syphoned to **Secondary** it's been long enough on the lees, will leave it in the glass demijohn
  for a few months
    - Syphoning did not go perfectly, some smaller pieces in the mix got syphoned up

<h3>Stabilization plan</h3>

- Completed: 2024-08-03
- Potassium Metabisulfite: 0.15g
- Potassium Sorbate : 0.2g

<h2> Post Ferment back sweetening</h2>
- Added on 2024-10-14
- 100g Honey Water Solution @ 2:1 or 66.6g Honey, and 33.3g Water

Tasting Notes:

- dry before back sweetening
- pre 2024-10-14 changes
    - Smells slightly of tomatoes
    - still has mild scent of rocket fuel, should dissapate with time
    - no spice from the chilli at-all
    - very little orange taste
- post 2024-10-14 changes
    - still a little dry, we only added about 66 grams of honey to around 4 litres of mead
    - Moving the sediment made the chilli flavour stronger
        - we may decide to add some of the leftover sediment to the bottles, it'll depend on a second tasting in a week
    - chilli flavour is plesant without being overpowering

Serving thoughts:
-  

## End Quantities:

note: smells unplesant, slightly like bad fermentation, we're hoping that will go away with time
