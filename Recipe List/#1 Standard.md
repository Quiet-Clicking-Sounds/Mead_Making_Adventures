1: bubbler secured in and shaken lightly seems to be making co2


<h3> Notes </h3>
2024-05-28 Brought some Fermaid K Yeast Nutrient, will add when it arrives,  fermentation appears slow currently, 
we didn't add much in the way of nutrient at the start, only using a standard beer making nutrient 

2024-05-29 Adding Fermaid K as co2 productions seems very low outside of agitation; will not be adding to other brew
I've now very little trust in our gravity readings, hopefully time & equipment will help

2024-05-31 A little dead yeast floating on-top, more bubbles at the airlock, and plenty of bubbles once agitated,
much happier with the progress of this one now

2024-05-31 14:00 Winetheif arrived today, took some more accurate readings. 1.060grav @ 22c, I'm willing to trust
these readings. We may end up with a sweeter or stronger brew than expected

2024-06-01 with nothing to back up my thoughts other than bubbles and yeast sediment, the mead looks much more healthy
at the moment than it did last week

2024-06-02 Refractometers are easier to use; I'll be using it for all but the first and last tests from now on I think
